Github Action to, based on git tags, generate convenience Docker tags.

#### Human language

In other words, this action suggests you what extra tags to create for Docker Hub upon new version-tag creation.  For example, given existing tags: `v1.0.0`, `v1.0.1`, `v1.1.0`, and new tag being added: `v1.0.2` this action would recommend the creation of `v1.0`, but not `:latest` (as a tag with higher version exists), nor `:v1` (as a newer tag with the same major version exists).

#### Geekspeak 

```shell script
$ INPUT_TAG="v1.0.2" \
  INPUT_CMD="echo 'v1.0.0 v1.0.1 v1.1.0' | tr ' ' '\n'" \
  ./entrypoint.sh | awk -F: '{print $NF}'
v1.0

$ INPUT_TAG="v1.1.2" \
  INPUT_CMD="echo 'v1.0.0 v1.0.1 v1.1.0' | tr ' ' '\n'" \
  ./entrypoint.sh | awk -F: '{print $NF}'
latest
v1
v1.1
```

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

### Minimal


```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'
â€¦

steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v1
- uses: meeDamian/tag-suggestions@1.0
```

### Arguments

| name             | required   | description 
|:----------------:|:----------:|-------------
| `tag`            | sometimes  | Git tag to base suggestions on.  If not provided, an extraction from `${GITHUB_REF}` is attempted (AKA not needed on git tag push).
| `cmd`            | no         | A command listing all existing tags to take into account for tags suggestion.  By default `git tag -l` is used.


### Advanced example

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@master

- uses: meeDamian/tag-suggestions@0.1
  with:
    tag: v1.3.6
    cmd: "git tag -l | grep variant-one"
```

This example would be useful if your repo contains 2 variants of your software.  It seeks tag suggestions for version `v1.3.6` only among tags that are marked as `variant-one`. 

### Versioning

As of Sep 2019, Github Actions doesn't natively understand shortened tags in `uses:` directive.

To go around that and not do what `git-tag-manual` calls _"[The insane thing]"_, I'm creating permanent git tags for each release in a semver format prefixed with `v`, **as well as** maintain branches with shortened tags.  You can see the exact process [here].

Ex. `1.0` branch always points to the newest `v1.0.x` tag.

In practice:

```yaml
# For exact version
steps:
  uses: meeDamian/tag-suggestions@v1.0.1
```
Or
```yaml
# For newest minor version 1.0
steps:
  uses: meeDamian/tag-suggestions@1.0
```

Note: It's likely branches will be deprecated once Github Actions fixes its limitation.
